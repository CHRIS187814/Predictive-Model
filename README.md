# Predictive Modelling

## Overview
This project builds and evaluates classification models to predict categorical outcomes. It includes data preprocessing, training Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models, evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and performing hyperparameter tuning. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and developed using IDLE Python 64-bit.

cd Predictive-Modelling
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Model Training Script
To train a predictive model:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

### Evaluating Model Performance
Run the evaluation script to assess the model’s performance:
```bash
python src/evaluate_model.py
```
